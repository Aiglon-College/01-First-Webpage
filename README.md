# üöÄ Assignment 1: Your First Webpage

Welcome to your first coding assignment!

For our first couple of lessons, we'll be using a **temporary** process to get started. We will use a simple online tool to edit our code and see it work, and then we will save our final work back here in your personal **GitHub repository**.

## ‚úÖ Your Goal

The goal of this task is to get comfortable with the most basic building blocks of the web by correctly using heading and paragraph tags in an HTML file.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Complete This Assignment (using our temporary workflow)

Follow these **four** steps carefully:

### Step 1: Get Your Starter Code

Open the `index.html` file in this repository. Select **all** of the text and copy it.

### Step 2: Open our Temporary Online Editor

In a new tab, go to the W3Schools "Tryit" Editor:  
[https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_editor](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_editor)

This is our temporary "workbench" where we can write code on the left and see a live preview of our webpage on the right.

### Step 3: Do the Work!

1. First, delete all the text in the left-hand window of the W3Schools editor. Then, paste in your starter code from Step 1.
2. Now, your mission is to replace the comment lines with real HTML code. Follow the instructions in the comments to complete these five tasks:
   - Add a Level 1 Heading (`<h1>`) with your name.
   - Add a Level 2 Heading (`<h2>`) with the text **"Fun Fact"**.
   - Add a Paragraph (`<p>`) with a short, fun sentence about yourself.
   - Add another Level 2 Heading (`<h2>`) with the text **"My Favourite Thing"**.
   - Add another Paragraph (`<p>`) describing that thing.
3. Click the **Run >** button to see your webpage come to life on the right!

   **Stuck?** Try this prompt like this in Gemini: "How do I use the `<h1>` tag in a webpage?" or use this starter:
   ```html
<h1>The Rock</h1>
```


### Step 4: Save Your Work to GitHub (This is how you hand in the assignment!)

When you are happy with your webpage in the W3Schools preview, you need to save it back in GitHub.

1. In the W3Schools editor, select and copy **all** of your finished code.
2. Come back to the `index.html` file here on GitHub and click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) in the top right to edit the file.
3. Delete all the old starter code and paste in your new, finished code.
4. Scroll to the top of the page and click the green **"Commit changes"** button to save your work.

That's it! You've just edited your first webpage and submitted your first assignment. **Well done!** üéâ
